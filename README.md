Cypress Testing Demo


This repository contains various **Cypress** test automation examples for web applications and APIs. The goal is to demonstrate best practices, explore advanced features, and create a learning environment for automated testing.


ðŸ“Œ What's Covered?


1. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- ðŸ“Œ Simulated login flow (filling in email, password, and authentication).
- ðŸ“Œ Interaction with buttons, inputs, and UI components.
- ðŸ“Œ Using the **Page Object Model (POM)** for better test organization.


2. API Testing (JSONPlaceholder)
- âœ… **GET:** Retrieving data from an endpoint.
- âœ… **POST:** Creating a new resource in the API.
- âœ… **PUT:** Updating an existing resource.
- âœ… **DELETE:** Removing a resource from the API.


3. Challenges and Solutions
- ðŸ”§ Correctly configuring and importing **Page Objects**.
- ðŸ”§ Resolving **Webpack Compilation Errors** and file import issues.
- ðŸ”§ Handling **dynamic selectors** for UI components.
- ðŸ”§ Dealing with **authentication** and complex form submissions.
- ðŸ”§ Integrating with **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions).
